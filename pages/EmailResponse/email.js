                How can we help you: New site launching soon using Next.js and we are thinking about using Vercel
                to host. I would like more information about the Enterprise option.
                <br/>
                <br/>Hi Joe,
                <br/><br/>
                Trust youâ€™re doing well!
                <br/><br/>
                Thanks for reaching out to Vercel. Firstly, I would like to congratulate you on your new site launching soon. 
                Please be advised that I can assist you with detailed information about Next.js with Vercel. 
                <br/><br/>
                Considering that you have a large set-up  of employees in your organisation, I would recommend Enterprise option. However, I will need to gather some more information on your specific requirement.
                <br/><br/>
                Please advise me a good time, I can schedule a meeting with you and can offer you the best solution.
                <br/><br/>
                Looking forward hearing from you soon !
                <br/><br/>
                Thanks,<br/>

            <li>Sales Inquiry: Would Pro or Enterprise fit better for my team?

                Employees: 10-100<br/>
                How can we help you: We are looking to re-platform our site and are considering Vercel. Would like
                to evaluate options to see if Pro or Enterprise would fit out needs better. Timeline is Q3. Can you
                help?<br/><br/>
                Hi Melissa,
                <br/><br/>
                I hope this email finds you well!
                <br/><br/>
                Thanks for your enquiry with Vercel. Certainly, I can assist you with information on migrating to Vercel from your current Platform.
                <br/><br/>
                As per my understanding, you might not need an Enterprise solution as you only need it for 100 employees max. My recommendation will be our pro solution as it caters your needs for current set-up. However, moving forward when your organisation grows we can always upgrade it to an Enterprise based on your requirement.
                <br/><br/>
                Please feel free to ask for any further information if needed.
                <br/><br/>
                Looking forward to work with you!
                <br/><br/>
                Thanks,<br/>
